With what truth I may say 
Roma Roma Roma 
non e puis come era prima 
My Lost William  
NU
by this thine urn
I [undecipherable] it as his find a tomb
that be 
Underneath this pyramid
lie thy bones -- if thou canst die
Rest thy bones -- this is a shrine
From thy 

Where art though gone my gentle child boy 
Didst [undecipherable] living weeds
Let me
Whose call I think thy spirit heeds
Within its high wall 
                     interior
              love
The grass living of living flowers
                             + weeds
Among these tombs + ruins wilds
Could I believe that
